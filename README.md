# My Reads Tracking App

This is a book tracking app using an external API: allows you to select and categorize books you have read, currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and client library that it should be persisted information as userâ€™s interacts with the application.


## Getting Started

### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/ryanwooj/reactnd-myreads-ryan.git
cd reactnd-myreads-ryan

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
```


## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

### Additional Functionality

This version of the app now supporting a rating Functionality.
User can set ratings for each book on shelf, and it gets stored in locally.
